    <h2>
        THE PROBLEM
    </h2>
    <p>
        The app does not provide enough in-depth information. Consequently, users are left dissatisfied and feel unsafe, causing a lower rate of returning customers.
    </p>
    <h2>
        THE SOLUTION
    </h2>
    <p>
        Improve the app by expanding the list of resources like virtual tours and safety guidelines so that our customers can make a more informed decision regarding their travel.
    </p>
    <h2>

        RESEARCH

    <p>
        In the research process, every integrant of the group was responsible for conducting one interview with a potential user to get the first insights. After this, we had to choose a competitor to make the competitor analysis to understand the weakness and strengths of the market. To finalize our research process, we had to do user testing to understand if our app wireframe would match our user’s expectations.
    </p>
    <h4>
        USER INTERVIEW
    </h4>
    <p>
        Interviewed five people, asking them about their travel plans pre-Covid and post-Covid. We developed our interview focusing on three main objectives: most important for traveling, budget, and how the users plan their traveling during/post-Covid. Surrounding those objectives, we designed an interview with an average of 30 questions.

    <h4>
        AFFINITY DIAGRAM
    </h4>
    <p>
        We created the Affinity Diagram to organize related facts and insights with all the insights that we got on the interviews. We could see some patterns in this research, so we divided the diagram into planning, budget, wants and needs, and covid. Takeaways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Covid is still a concern
        </li>
        <li>
            Budget matter
        </li>
        <li>
            Travel for pleasure
        </li>
        <li>
            Use mostly credit card
        </li>
    </ul>
